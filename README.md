# ft_containers
## In this 42 project, we had to implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library.

### Containers:
* vector: _sequence container representing an array that can change in size (dynamically allocated)_
* map: _associative container that store elements (key value + mapped value) in the form of a BST (Binary Search Tree)_
* stack: _container adaptator that allows manipulating other containers in a LIFO manner (last-in first-out)_  
  
### Additional:
* iterators_traits
* reverse_iterator
* enable_if
* is_integral
* equal and/or lexicographical_compare
* std::pair
* std::make_pair  

### Testing requirements:  
* produce two binaries that run the same tests: one with my containers
only, and the other one with the STL containers
* compare outputs and performance / timing

This is the first project I made after learning C++ basics.
