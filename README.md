# ft_containers
## In this 42 project, we had to implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library.

### Containers:
* vector
* map
* stack  
  
### Additional:
* iterators_traits
* reverse_iterator
* enable_if
* is_integral
* equal and/or lexicographical_compare
* std::pair
* std::make_pair  

### Testing requirements:  
* produce two binaries that run the same tests: one with my containers
only, and the other one with the STL containers
* compare outputs and performance / timing

This is the first project I had to do after learning C++.
